# Exercise 1
Simple Encryption #1 - Alternating Split
Implement a pseudo-encryption algorithm which given a string S and an integer N concatenates all the odd-indexed characters of S with all the even-indexed characters of S, this process should be repeated N times.

# Exercise 2 
Formatting a number as price
Numbers should use the standard comma for every 3 numbers and dot to separate the cents, cents need to be truncated to 2 decimals, in the case that the decimal part of the number is 1 character long or none you should add 0's so that the result will always have 2 decimal characters, the function will also evaluate negative numbers.
